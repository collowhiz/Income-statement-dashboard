A Power BI dashboard project designed to analyze revenue, COGS, and profit trends for a small business segment. The report reveals critical insights into financial performance, seasonal patterns, discount impacts, and strategic opportunities for revenue and profit growth.

## 📘 Extended Description

This project focuses on using Power BI to visualize and analyze key financial metrics—**Revenue**, **Profit**, **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**, and **Discounts**—from financial data sourced from Power Bi covering multiple financial years and months. It targets the **Small Business** segment within a broader business ecosystem that includes Enterprise, Government, and Channel Partner verticals.

The dashboard offers interactive filters for product, country, financial year, and month, making it easy to uncover both high-level trends and granular insights. The aim was to provide a decision-support tool for stakeholders to:

- Understand profit shortfalls relative to targets
- Identify cost-driving factors behind reduced margins
- Optimize discount strategies by analyzing their effect on sales and profit
- Leverage seasonal trends for more strategic planning

This project was built using **Power BI Desktop**, sourcing raw data from a simulated income statement and transforming it into actionable insights using DAX measures, calculated columns, slicers, and custom visualizations.

- **Revenue Performance**: Achieved $42M in total revenue, with visible gaps vs. targets in some years (e.g., -48.1% in 2014).
- **Profit Margins**: Total profit of $136.54K, falling short of the $200K goal by 31.73%, largely due to elevated COGS during certain periods.
- **Discount Impact**: High discount bands increased unit sales but negatively affected profit margins, emphasizing the need for a more selective discounting approach.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Sales and profit metrics show strong quarterly variations, highlighting seasonal patterns that can inform marketing and inventory strategies.
